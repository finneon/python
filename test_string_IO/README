- Loggers are static objects managed by the module itself. When you create
  one, it won't be removed until you leave the shell. Thas is way it is 
  advise not to create thousands of loggers with different names.
  That's the module design, nothing you can do about it.

- Logger configuration should be done in the 'main' function *only*.

- one way to cleanup a logger is to remove all its handlers, i.e. 
  logger.handlers = [], but if you need to do this you may have done 
  something wrong.
